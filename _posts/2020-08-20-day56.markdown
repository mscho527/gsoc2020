Today, one of my mentors Shiv and I took a function-by-function review over the DDEC6 code (which is very complicated and long). After having conversation on which parts of the code can potentially be separated out as new functions, I worked on cleaning up the function for most of the time today. Hopefully, the readability of the code would have been improved at least slightly.

With the program end date just on the corner, I am starting to think how the final submission would be like. Having a final blog post that summarizes the PRs I have written over the summer with links is a possibility that I am considering for now.
