After making some changes that were requested from my mentors on the QTAIM code, I've spent today adding a method that reads in `.cube` files to construct `Volume` objects. This would allow users to start the Bader calculations from pre-calculated densities and would also make it possible to run tests on a finer grid without causing Travis to complain about the test taking too long without any output.

While adding the read-in routine for the `.cube` file, I figured out that the write-out routine that has pre-existed has a tiny bug when the grid information is written. `cclib` assumes the origin to be the leftmost and topmost point in the grid, whereas `cube` files assume origin to be the center of the grid where the origin is moved into.

I am now generating a sample `.cube` file with relatively fine grid (.01 angstoms spacing) which would be added to the test (hopefully) tomorrow.
