I was trying to get step 3 of the DDEC6 algorithm crossed off today, but it seems like there is something wrong that I am doing with the spherical averaging. I am seeing values deviate greatly for elements of `y_a` which are near the nuclei. I can't say much why this is happening but should ask for assistance from my mentors today. :(
