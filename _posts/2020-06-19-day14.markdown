Based on Dr. Langner's suggestion that I [split the pull requests further](https://github.com/cclib/cclib/issues/880) into so that each PR is as small as possible, I worked on executing this principle today. Working on this also made me think more about the development flow I usually adopt. When I write small codes in science, I find myself coding without much set plan. While this may work when I work individually, I am learning with the experiences this summer that deliberately laying out plans and developing under the plan is the way that works for group work.

Today may not have been the time I used to write any new code, but I believe that the work I have done today would actually help me get more efficient over the rest of the days and weeks this summer. I haven't been able to do so due to the time constraint, but I will be adding the overall plan this summer as Github Issues over the weekend & Monday, following Shiv's advice. This should also help everyone in the `cclib` organization keep track of the progress.
