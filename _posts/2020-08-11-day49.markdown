Today, I have worked on writing a code that calculates ***G<sub>A</sub>*** and ***H<sub>A</sub>*** to evaluate ***&kappa;<sub>A</sub>*** in order to optimize grid weights in DDEC6 steps 4-7. I think most of the code is well implemented, but I see that there are some critical discrepancies in u<sub>A</sub> values compared with `chargemol`. I will review the code over tomorrow to fix any mistakes and hopefully have a usable method.
